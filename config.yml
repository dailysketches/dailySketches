#on individual sketches and templates. For the most-part you will access these
#from the Finder shortcuts in the root directory of the sketch manager repo. The
#paths are included here so that rake tasks can help you copy from your
#openFrameworks 'apps' directory to the sketch and jekyll repos for publishing.
